Return the Remainder from Two Numbers

There is a single operator in C#, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.
Examples

Remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

Remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

Remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9

Remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0

Notes

    The tests only use positive and negative integers.
    Don't forget to return the result.
